# 5V Power Supply for Breadboard

This project is a custom PCB designed to provide a stable **5V power output** for breadboard-based electronic circuits. It is compact, easy to integrate, and suitable for prototyping or small-scale hardware projects.

## Features
- **Input Voltage**: Supports standard DC input (via barrel jack or pin header)
- **Output Voltage**: 5V regulated
- **Form Factor**: Fits directly onto a breadboard
- **Indicator LED**: Shows power status
- **Easy Connectivity**: Output pins match breadboard power rails

## Components Used
- Voltage regulator (e.g., AMS1117-5.0 or 7805)
- DC barrel jack
- Power indicator LED + current limiting resistor
- Capacitors for voltage stability
- Pin headers for breadboard connection

## Usage
1. Connect the DC input (recommended 7â€“12V).
2. Plug the module into your breadboard power rails.
3. The onboard regulator will provide a steady 5V output to your circuit.

 

## Applications
- Prototyping circuits on a breadboard
- Powering small microcontroller projects
- Testing sensors and modules
